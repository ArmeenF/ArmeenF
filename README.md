<h3>How I'd define myself...literally</h3>

 ```Python
 class Armeen(Person):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'ArmeenF'
        self.age = 25
        self.education = ['University of Washington', 'BS in Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics']
        self.hobbies = ['Lifting', 'Soccer', 'Eating']
    
    def current_location(self):
        return 'Bothell, WA, USA'
    
    def currently(self):
        return {
            'studying': [' Virtualisation, Containerisation'],
            'reading': ['How to Win Friends & Influence People'],
            'tinkering': ['Networking', 'DevOps', 'Automation']
